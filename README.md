# Hospital Readmission Dashboard (Tableau Visualization)

## Overview
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing hospital readmission trends across multiple facilities. By comparing WGU Hospital to competing hospitals, the dashboard highlights key demographic patterns, performance gaps, and opportunities for targeted improvement. The visualizations support data‑driven decision‑making by enabling users to explore readmission rates by hospital, gender, and age group.

## Datasets
- External Dataset: Riyadh Hospital Admissions Dataset (2020–2024)
- WGU Dataset: Provided hospital readmission data for WGU Hospital
Both datasets include demographic details, admission information, and readmission outcomes.
## How to Use the Dashboard
- Total Readmissions:
Compare overall readmission rates across hospitals. Select one or multiple hospitals to update the bar chart dynamically. Toggle Yes/No to isolate readmitted vs. non‑readmitted patients.
- Readmission Details – Gender:
Explore gender‑specific readmission trends. Filter by hospital or toggle Male/Female to analyze patterns within or across facilities.
- Readmission Details – Age Group:
Examine readmission rates across age groups using an interactive bubble chart. Select specific hospitals or age ranges to identify demographic‑specific trends.
## Key Insights
- WGU Hospital has the lowest overall readmission rate (36.69%) among all hospitals.
- Patients aged 66 and older show significantly higher readmission rates at WGU compared to competitors.
- Female patients at WGU have a 49% readmission rate, higher than competing hospitals.
- WGU performs strongly in the 18–45 and 46–65 age groups, maintaining lower readmission rates than others.
- These insights highlight opportunities for targeted interventions in older and female patient populations.
## Design & Accessibility
- Dashboard uses colorblind‑friendly palettes to ensure inclusive interpretation.
- Interactive filters (hospital, gender, age group) allow users to explore data from multiple perspectives.
- Visuals are structured to support executive‑level decision‑making with clear labels, intuitive layouts, and progressive storytelling.
## Storytelling Approach
- Begins with a high‑level comparison of overall readmission performance.
- Progresses into deeper demographic insights (gender, age).
- Highlights contrasts between WGU and competing hospitals to reveal strengths and improvement areas.
- Guides the audience toward actionable conclusions supported by data.
## Conclusion
This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive view of hospital readmission trends, enabling leadership to identify performance gaps and prioritize improvement strategies. By focusing on high‑risk demographics—particularly older adults and female patients—WGU Hospital can implement targeted interventions to reduce readmissions and enhance patient outcomes.
